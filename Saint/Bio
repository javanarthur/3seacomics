Saint Adjei

Alias: Saint

Role: Tech Engineer / Innovator / Future Hero "Titan"

Appearance:
Saint is the youngest of the Adjei siblings, standing tall with a strong, athletic build that reflects both discipline and determination. His skin is deep brown, and he keeps his hair in a short, natural afro. He often wears a fitted yellow-and-black tech suit of his own design, reinforced with experimental materials. His sharp gaze and calm expression reflect both intellect and resilience. Saint’s look embodies a man who is as comfortable commanding machines as he is stepping onto the battlefield himself.

Bio:
Saint Adjei is a brilliant engineer, scientist, and entrepreneur, once the leading supplier of cutting-edge weaponry and advanced technology for StealthGuard. Though young, he possesses a genius-level understanding of robotics, AI, and defensive systems, always pushing innovation beyond its limits. Unlike his siblings, Saint balances logic with vision — a builder at heart, but also a strategist who knows technology is both a tool and a weapon. Over time, he evolves from the team’s supplier into a warrior himself, creating the titanium-based suit that transforms him into Titan, a symbol of unyielding strength.
