Elise Adjei (Sno)

Alias: Sno

Role: Tech & Hacking Genius

Appearance:
Sno is a striking young Black woman in her late twenties with a compact, voluminous afro framing her face. She has a smooth brown complexion, sharp expressive eyes, and strong features that give her a natural confidence. Her usual style is practical yet bold — a fitted yellow top paired with white cargo pants — clothes that allow her to move easily between computer labs and high-stakes missions. Whether lit by glowing holographic screens or the chaos of the field, Sno’s presence is commanding, reflecting both her intellect and her fearless determination.

Bio:
The eldest Adjei sibling, Elise — better known as Sno — is a brilliant hacker with an unrivalled ability to infiltrate systems and uncover secrets. Sharp, resourceful, and fiercely protective of her younger siblings, Sno became a key ally to the Nightwatchers by decoding encrypted enemy networks and designing stealth tech. Her calm logic balances out the team’s intensity, though she isn’t afraid to dive into danger when her family is threatened.
