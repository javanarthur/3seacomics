Sage Adjei

Alias: Sage

Role: Investigative Reporter / Truth-Seeker

Appearance:
Sage is a sharp, stylish woman in her mid-twenties with a bold, modern edge to her look. She wears her hair in a short, asymmetrical cut with one side shaved into intricate patterns while the other side falls in textured curls. Her deep brown skin and piercing, observant eyes radiate confidence and curiosity — the look of someone who’s always searching for the truth. She often dresses in sleek, fitted clothing, like her black turtleneck top, blending professionalism with street-smart presence. Her look captures her dual life: respected journalist by day, ally to the Nightwatchers by night.

Bio:
As the middle Adjei sibling, Sage is the team’s voice of reason and relentless seeker of truth. An investigative reporter by profession, she has built a reputation for exposing corruption, conspiracy, and cover-ups — often putting herself in danger to protect the innocent. Her fearless questioning and keen instincts make her a natural strategist, often uncovering threads others overlook. Though she doesn’t wield tech like Sno or invent like Saint, her greatest weapon is her insight: knowing when someone is lying, and digging until the real story comes to light. Sage brings heart, wit, and an unshakable determination to uncover the forces threatening her world.
